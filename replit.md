# requests-connection-manager

## Overview

This is a Python package that extends the popular `requests` library with advanced connection management features. The package provides a `ConnectionManager` class that wraps HTTP requests with connection pooling, automatic retries, rate limiting, and circuit breaker functionality. It's designed as a drop-in enhancement for existing `requests` code with thread-safe operations.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Core Components:**
- `ConnectionManager`: Main orchestrator class that coordinates all connection management features
- `TokenBucket`: Rate limiting implementation using token bucket algorithm
- `CircuitBreaker`: Fail-fast pattern implementation for handling service failures
- Custom exception hierarchy for specific error handling

**Architecture Pattern:**
- Decorator/Wrapper pattern: Enhances existing `requests` functionality without modifying core behavior
- Strategy pattern: Configurable retry, rate limiting, and circuit breaker strategies
- Observer pattern: Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities

## Key Components

### 1. Connection Manager (`manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Central coordinator for all connection management features
- **Key Features**:
  - Integration with `urllib3.PoolManager` for connection pooling
  - Wraps `requests.Session` with enhanced capabilities
  - Thread-safe operation using locks
  - Configurable retry strategies via `urllib3.util.retry.Retry`

### 2. Rate Limiting (External `ratelimit` Library)
- **Library**: Uses `ratelimit` package with decorators
- **Features**:
  - `@sleep_and_retry` and `@limits` decorators for automatic rate limiting
  - Configurable calls per period
  - Thread-safe operation handled by library
  - Prevents API abuse through request throttling

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern (External `pybreaker` Library)
- **Library**: Uses `pybreaker.CircuitBreaker` 
- **Purpose**: Fail-fast mechanism for handling service failures
- **Benefits**: Automatic failure detection and recovery, prevents cascading failures

### 4. Exception Hierarchy (`exceptions.py`)
- **Base**: `ConnectionManagerError` for all package-specific errors
- **Specific Exceptions**:
  - `RateLimitExceeded`: When rate limits are hit
  - `CircuitBreakerOpen`: When circuit breaker prevents requests
  - `MaxRetriesExceeded`: When retry attempts are exhausted

## Data Flow

1. **Request Initiation**: Client code calls ConnectionManager methods
2. **Rate Limiting Check**: TokenBucket validates if request can proceed
3. **Circuit Breaker Check**: Verifies if service is available
4. **Connection Pool**: PoolManager manages HTTP connections
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff on failures
6. **Response Handling**: Success/failure updates circuit breaker state
